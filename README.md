# 🚛 ✈️ Unity Vehicle Simulation (Ground & Air)

A dual-scene Unity project demonstrating vehicle physics, player controller scripts, and camera tracking. This project features two distinct gameplay modes: a truck obstacle course and a plane flight simulation.

## 🎮 Project Overview
This is my **2nd Unity project** created while learning game development from scratch. The focus of this project was to understand:
- **Player Input:** Handling `WASD` and `Arrow Keys` for movement.
- **Transformations:** Using `Vector3` for real-time translation and rotation.
- **Camera Mechanics:** Scripting a camera to smoothly follow the player object.
- **Collision Detection:** Interacting with static obstacles in the environment.

## 🚀 Features

### Scene 1: Truck Driver
- **Controls:** Drive a truck forward/backward and steer left/right.
- **Physics:** Navigate through a road filled with crates and barriers.
- **Camera:** Follows the truck from a third-person perspective to ensure a clear view of the road.

### Scene 2: Plane Flight
- **Controls:** Fly a plane through 3D space.
- **Mechanics:** Includes pitch and yaw controls to navigate around floating obstacles.
- **Challenge:** Avoid collisions with suspended structures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity 2022 (or your version)
- **Language:** C#
- **Key Concepts:** `transform.Translate`, `transform.Rotate`, `LateUpdate` (for camera), Box Colliders.

## 🕹️ Controls
| Action | Key Binding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Move Forward/Back** | `W` / `S` or `Up` / `Down` |
| **Turn Left/Right** | `A` / `D` or `Left` / `Right` |

## 📸 Screenshots
*(You can add screenshots of your truck and plane scenes here later)*

## 📝 Learning Journey
As a beginner in Unity, this project helped me solidify the basics of object manipulation in 3D space. I am currently building my portfolio by creating projects from scratch and documenting my progress.
